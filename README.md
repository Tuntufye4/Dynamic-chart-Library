# Dynamic-chart-Library
This is a PHP snippet code which shows how you can dynamically create charts. I used a case of covid 19 to display the concept.
I used Google charts in this library. You can download google charts here:https://developers.google.com/chart/
There are 2 files in this library: covidchart.php and cases_db.sql.
Import cases_db.sql in your database engine and run the covidchart.php in your local web server.
